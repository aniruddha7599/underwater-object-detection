Underwater Object Detection and Segmentation

üìå Overview

This project explores deep learning approaches for underwater object detection and segmentation.
Underwater environments pose unique challenges such as:

Poor visibility and lighting,

Dynamic and complex backgrounds,

Occlusions and overlapping objects.

We evaluate and compare three models:

U-Net

ResNet50

ResNet50 + Graph Attention Network (GAT)

The goal is to investigate how graph-based learning improves feature representation and segmentation performance in underwater imagery.

üß† Methodology
1. Dataset

We use the Fish4Knowledge (F4K) dataset, which includes underwater scenes categorized into:

Complex Background (ComplexBkg)

Crowded

Dynamic Background (DynamicBkg)

Hybrid

Standard

Images are resized to 240√ó320 pixels with augmentations:

Random cropping, flipping, rotation, and color adjustments.

2. Models

U-Net: Encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation.

ResNet50: Deep residual network modified with upsampling layers for segmentation.

ResNet50 + GAT: Graph Attention Network applied at the bottleneck to capture long-range dependencies in feature space.

3. Training Configuration

Optimizer: Adam, LR = 1e-4 with cosine annealing.

Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy + Dice loss.

Epochs: 200.

Gradient clipping, mixed precision training, and NaN checks for stability.

üìä Results

The figure below summarizes performance across challenges:

Key Observations

ResNet50 consistently achieves the best results, with highest F-measure and Precision across categories.

ResNet50+GAT performs closely, especially in Hybrid and Crowded scenarios, showing the benefit of attention-based context modeling.

U-Net lags behind due to its simpler architecture and lack of pretrained weights.

Dynamic backgrounds remain the most challenging scenario.
